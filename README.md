# Simple Danted install

This is a script to install danted on Ubuntu.
So far it's been tested on Ubuntu 16.06, but it should work on newer versions too.

Usage:

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pleszkan/simple-danted-install/master/danteinstall.sh
chmod +x danteinstall.sh
./danteinstall.sh <password>
```
